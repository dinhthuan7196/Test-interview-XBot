To gain an understanding of how you interpret a visual design into built HTML, we would like you to build this conversation view for us as if it was part of a responsive web page. 

Please pay particular attention to visual accuracy and the structure of your DOM and CSS. Use HTML and CSS only. No Javascript, frameworks, etc.

Mobile screen layout should remain until 600px wide. Medium screen layout from 601px and above.

It should be compatible with the latest stable build of Chrome Browser.

Build as much as you can in up to two hours. Don't worry if you don't get all the way through it.

Any questions please email me at maidh@xbot.com.vn

Thanks,
Marco
